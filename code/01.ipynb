The third column does not appear to be in reference to the balance transfer grace period as there is no information (length of grace period) specified for 581 either.

    "As mentioned several times, this dataset is full of redundant features where the first column is a boolean, and the second column actually contains the data, but only the first column is 'Yes'. With these, I would like to get rid of as many redundant features as I can, and I'm realizing that I can probably drop the first column by setting NaNs in the second column to either 0 or str type \"None\" depending on the dtype. This way, I retain the original meaning contained in the first column, I have a straightforward fill technique and I can drop many redundant features."

Chris filled in the missing percentages with 4% and stated, \"admittedly a quick decision, but given time constraints and the given value of FT fee type for the remaining null values, we imputed 4% as a guess from the above.\"\n",

Four is simply the question number used to generate the FTFT data, and the number of entries with this value, not any sort of percentage data. I may be incorrect, but I'll assume that Chris was simply rushed and picked 4%. I'll fill using the average percent for existing FTF data:"
